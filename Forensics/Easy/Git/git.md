## Git Is Good

The flag used to be there. But then I redacted it. Good Luck. https://mega.nz/#!3CwDFZpJ!Jjr55hfJQJ5-jspnyrnVtqBkMHGJrd6Nn_QqM7iXEuc

### Approach

After unzipping the `zip` file, I found that the resultant folder was empty (or was it ðŸ‘€)...

Some knowledge in git made me suspect they were hidden directories and files (i.e. using the `.` prefix-meaning that it is hidden unless we do a `ls -la` in the command line). Using [this article](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History), we can gain some inspiration of how to extract the contents of the commit.

$ git log -p -2
