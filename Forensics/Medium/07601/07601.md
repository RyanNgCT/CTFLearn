[Link](https://mega.nz/#!CXYXBQAK!6eLJSXvAfGnemqWpNbLQtOHBvtkCzA7-zycVjhHPYQQ) I think I lost my flag in there. Hopefully, it won't get attacked...

### Approach 
Hmm lost the flag... Sounds like the file is within the image? 

My first instinct was to use the `file` command to check if the file was in the first place in the correct format (or the author might have changed the extension to mask data. 
We downloaded a `png` image but this instead was a `jpeg`.
```
$ file AGT.png                                                               
AGT.png: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, aspect ratio, density 1x1, segment length 16, baseline, precision 8, 300x168, components 3
```

So I decided to make a copy of it in the original extension. To do this:
```
$ cp AGT.png AGT.jpeg 
```

Thereafter, I used exiftool to check for any suspicious information inm the file but there was none.
```
$ exiftool AGT.png

```

Since I found nothing, I decided to go back to the assumption that there was a hidden file, which could be discovered using `binwalk`.
```
$  binwalk -e AGT.jpeg

Hmm the last directory seems suspicious... `I Warned You.jpeg`. Opening it in any photo viewer, it was nothing but empty... Could there be something in the strings?

```
$ strings I\ Warned\ You.jpeg | grep -i "CTF"
ABCTF{Du$t1nS_D0jo}1r
```

And there we have our flag!
